# Predictive Modeling for Loan Eligibility Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility based on applicant details. The model analyzes various factors like income, employment status, credit history, and loan amount to determine whether a loan application should be approved or denied.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes numerical data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selects the most relevant features to enhance model accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XG Boost).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
